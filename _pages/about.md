Welcome to my website!

I am a computer science doctoral researcher at the [University of Bath's Accountable, Responsible and Transparent AI Centre for Doctoral Training](https://cdt-art-ai.ac.uk/). My research focuses on the value alignment problem in artificial intelligence: how we can get AI systems to make decisions that support human values. In particular, I focus on modelling value constructs for joint human and AI decision-making and auditing, taking an interdisciplinary approach by using research from psychology. I am also interested in research about the integration of AI in society, and how we can do this in a way that is safe, egailitarian, and empowering rather than replacing.

In addition to my research in computer science, I hold a master's degree in applied mathematics from the University of Bath, and have five years of work experience in the finance and defence sectors.
